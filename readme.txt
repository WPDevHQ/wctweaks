Think of this plugin as a handy helper for those little nags that come with setting up your WooCommerce based store. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
*Note:* This plugin currently only performs rewrite rules for the store permalinks to allow the use of "shop" as a category base without running in to the "Oops 404" moments.
This is a work in progress project and does not currently support sub categories i.e. yourdomain.tld/shop/main-category/second-category 
Secondary categories are accessible at yourdomain.tld/shop/second-category

If you activate the plugin after setting your permalinks then you need to revisit the permalinks screen and resave your settings in order to reflush the rules.
