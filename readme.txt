Custom tweaks for WooCommerce based sites.

== Description ==

Think of this plugin as a handy helper for those little nags that come with setting up your WooCommerce based store. 

*Note:* This plugin currently only performs rewrite rules for the store permalinks to allow the use of "shop" as a category base without running in to those "Oops 404" moments.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `theme-customisations` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Add your customisations to the plugin either locally or via Plugins > Editor in the Dashboard
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Done!

== Usage ==

* Activate the plugin.
* Go to Settings and set your permalinks :)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've activated the plugin and still getting a 404 error - why? =

If you activate the plugin after setting your permalinks then you need to revisit the permalinks screen and resave your settings in order to reflush the rules.
